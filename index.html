      <h4 class="job-website">United Rentals</h4>
      <p class="">Running and managing new Truck Fleet Branch.  United Rentals opened a new branch and sector of buisness to begin providing pickup trucks, stake bed trucks, and passenger vans to contractors to meet the growing demand for a mobile workforce.  I was put in charge of running this operation out of PDX serving the greater Oregon and Washington regions with some customers further away as well.  From May 2021 we started to accrue a truck fleet and rental contracts, by November we had 95 units on rent at nearly 100% on rent.  Next year, 2022, we expect to double our fleet to nearly 200 units or 7 million dollars in assets, and much of next year's order consists of electric Ford pickups.  United Rentals as a whole also plans on nearly doubling the amount of truck fleet locations from 12 to about 24 in 2022.  I have continued to learn how to take care of a customer's needs and always go the extra mile.  I am learning how to manage our assets and costs by running the branch.  Everyday is a chance to learn more and improve on the companies representation to the customer.</p>

Every batch is hand made by artisan craftsman that strive to make every batch like the first one. I came to the idea of creating a hand cream when I realized that I was allergic to every brand that I tried. The overuse of artificial scents and ingredients lead to my allergic reaction. I set out to create a product that was derived solely from nature with no parabens or artificial ingredients. I get my beeswax from a local beekeeper.  Our bees take pollen from the surrounding area and make honey and beeswax. They are never feed a corn syrup solution, which is attributing to shorter bee lifespans and a weakening of the bee genetics.  </p>

      <h4 class="job-website"><a href="https://www.oinkari.org/">Oinkari Basque Dancers</a></h4>
      <p class="">Since the age of eight I have danced in Basque dancing programs until moving to Portland after high school. With the adult group, the Oinkari Basque Dancers, the Basque Government paid for us to tour the Basque Country in the summer of 2011.  The Onikari's are considered to be part of the reason that Basque dancing survived the oppression of the Basques by Francisco Franco.  My Great Grandpa moved from his hometown of Kortezubi to the States at age 18 for these reasons.</p>
